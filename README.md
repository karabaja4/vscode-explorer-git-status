# vscode-explorer-git-status
Highlighting of git added, modified and ignored files inside Visual Studio Code File Explorer (similar to Atom).

You can modify the colors inside the `dist.min.js` source, or modify them in `dev.js` and reminify the file.

# Change Log

* 28.6.2017: Fixed a bug where plugin would not load when reopening the project.
* 30.6.2017: Added highlighting of parent directories of modified files (as Atom does).
* 1.7.2017: File matching is now done using full file or directory path. Before this change the directory was highlighted if it had the same name as another changed directory.

# About

**WARNING**: This is NOT an extension. Because this code is basically a hack that modifies Visual Studio Code's GUI, it has to manually be appended to Visual Studio Code's internal files which is not officially supported and not recommended for novice users. If you don't feel comfortable modifying Visual Studio Code's internal files please don't use this. I am not responsible for any damage.

# Installation

Open the following file:

`{VS Code directory}/resources/app/out/vs/workbench/electron-browser/workbench.main.js`

[Note for Mac Users: Open the app from the /Applications folder directly in VS Code and navigate to the same path listed above.]

as an administrator (or root) in your favorite text editor (make sure to make a backup of this file beforehand).

Copy the code from `dist.min.js` to the **end of the file** and restart Visual Studio Code. Done!

You will need to repeat this process on every Visual Studio Code update as `workbench.main.js` will be replaced with a newer version.

After installation you will get a warning that your Visual Studio Code installation is corrupt:

This is because Visual Studio Code does a background check to detect if the installation has been changed on disk, and displays a warning if it detects any third party modifications. You can permanently hide this warning by clicking `Don't show again`.
